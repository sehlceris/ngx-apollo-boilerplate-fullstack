# key-auth

This folder has tools for:
- generating RSA public/private keypairs
- flattening the keypairs to a single line so you can put them in the environment config
- testing token generation/verification using the keypairs

## generate RSA keys from terminal

```
openssl genrsa -f4 -out private.key 4096
openssl rsa -in private.key -outform PEM -pubout -out public.key
```

## usage

### generating keys for production

```
npm run generate
```

### generating (smaller) keys for dev

```
npm run generate:dev
```

### testing out generated keys

```
npm i
npm start
```
